# flyhindrain_clustering
Python 2.7
In this project, we will apply and test algorithms for computing clusters/modules on neuronal networks such as those for the fly hindbrain. Many of these algorithms are likely to run very slowly on large networks, so you have ample scope for developing clever strategies to speed them up. Another important direction will be to identify clusters (of neurons) that you compute with regions in the brain.

Packages required:
networkx
matplotlib
python-louvain
